Functional/Architectural Requirements:

Deliver four backend endpoints (no front end, no HTML) that will be the start of user management for a new application.  \
The endpoints shall create, read, update, and delete new users.  
The properties of a user object are left up to you.
Enable appropriate authentication and validation on these endpoints. 
The user’s data shall be stored in DynamoDB with primary and sort keys named ‘_pk0’ and _’sk0’ respectively. 
Deployment of these APIs can be provided through your preferred Infrastructure-As-Code framework.

Required AWS services:
                API Gateway
                DynamoDB

Prohibited AWS services:
                Lambda

All other AWS services optional per your design.

Deliveries:

    IAC code to deploy.
    Instructions so we can deploy and test the solution.
    Postman file we can use to exercise the deployed endpoints
